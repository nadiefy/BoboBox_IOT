# Paket Box berbasis IoT

This project is a smart package delivery notification system using an ESP32 microcontroller. It combines an ultrasonic sensor, an infrared (IR) sensor, a servo motor, and a Telegram bot to create an intelligent system that notifies the user when a package is detected and allows remote control of the package box.




## Acknowledgements

 - Create a Telegram Bot Open Telegram and search for "BotFather" and "ChatID". Start a chat with BotFather, ChatID and create a new bot using the command /newbot. Follow the instructions to set up your bot and get the bot token and your ID. Note down the bot token and your ID, as it will be used in your code.

 - Circuit Diagram Connect the components to the ESP32. You are free to choose any pins for the connections, but ensure to update the code accordingly.

 - WiFi and Telegram Bot Credentials Replace "nama_wifi", "pass_wifi", "isi_tokenbot_telegram", and "isi_chatid_telegram" with your WiFi credentials and Telegram bot information.

 - Upload the Code Connect your ESP32 to your computer. Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board and port. Upload the code to your ESP32.
